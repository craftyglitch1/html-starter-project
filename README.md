# HTML Starter Project
I wanted to make a simple project with comments to help someone who is learning web devolopment.
This isnt the best tutorial out there but im trying alright? :(

# THIS ISNT JUST HTML
I know the title says *html* starter project. But it will have JavaScript and CSS (eventually lol)
